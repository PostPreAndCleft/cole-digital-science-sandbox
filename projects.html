        My program aims to map the structural principles of synaptic organization and turn them into
        leverage points for intervention, using light and electron microscopy.

        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I will identify the proteins that constitute and regulate transsynaptic assemblies, classify
          common assembly types and link them to synaptic function, and determine how assemblies remodel
          during activity to sustain plasticity and memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manual tomographic image analysis is a major bottleneck. To unlock tomography at scale, I am
          developing open, automated analysis tools so the field can detect disease-relevant organizational
          phenotypes&mdash;tether density, PSD fragmentation, assembly disruption&mdash;that may indicate
          early markers of synaptic vulnerabilities in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.

        <h2 class="section-title">Project 1: Transsynaptic assemblies in synaptic health and degeneration</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The prevalence of transsynaptic assemblies in excitatory and inhibitory synapses suggests they
          play a fundamental role in synaptic function. Cell adhesion molecules such as neurexins and
          neuroligins individually influence presynaptic or postsynaptic functions, and also bind together
          to form cleft-spanning complexes. Understanding the composition and function of core assemblies
          will reveal how assemblies affect synaptic processes.

          <p>
            Investigate structural changes in the presynaptic compartment resulting from knockout of
            postsynaptic scaffolding proteins (PSD-95 family) in dissociated rat hippocampal neuronal cultures.
            Immuno-EM will visualize and quantify presynaptic structural changes.

          <p>
            Evaluate structural transformations in transsynaptic assemblies using electron tomography on
            AMPA or high K+ stimulated synaptosomes derived from rat hippocampal tissue. Characterize the
            number and type of transsynaptic structures to understand how assemblies dissociate with activity.

            Use APEX2 peroxidase labeling to identify critical transsynaptic assembly structures in electron
            tomograms of resting and stimulated cultures and isogenic human iPSC-derived neurons with APOE3
            or APOE4 alleles. Compare assembly organization and remodeling during activity between healthy
            and AD-risk backgrounds.

        <h2 class="section-title">Project 2: Accelerating tomographic analysis with advanced segmentation software</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Volumetric microscopy generates valuable, information-rich datasets requiring sophisticated
          processing methods. Data languishing on drives holds untapped discoveries because time-consuming
          manual segmentation restricts complete analysis. I am continuing an open-source project with
          collaborative developers from clinical and basic research backgrounds.

          <p class="aim-title">Aim 1: Extend the WebKnossos platform</p>
          <p>
            In collaboration with the Kristen Harris Lab's pyReconstruct team, build on the existing
            web-based WebKnossos segmentation platform. Extend functionality to support more tomographic
            modalities including nanoscale electron tomography, correlative light and electron microscopy
            (CLEM), and clinical imaging such as MRI. Refine the user interface to be accessible to non-specialists.

          <p class="aim-title">Aim 2: Plugin system for algorithm contribution</p>
          <p>
            Develop a plug-in system that enables laboratories to contribute advanced algorithms directly
            to the segmentation platform. This will ease burdens on algorithm developers while lowering
            barriers to adoption. A robust, ImageJ-like environment for volumetric algorithms will accelerate
            analysis of volumetric datasets and encourage community-wide adoption across neuroscience.
